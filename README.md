Simulation of aircraft motion is one of the most important topics in the aerospace field.
Autopilots are designed based on these simulations. In this project,
I have tried to simulate a  typical Cessna 172 aircraft flying in a normal left-hand circuit pattern.
In the first phase, I  developed a method for the aircraft to simply do an ideal circuit. In the second phase, 
I added wind  and demonstrated its effects on the aircraftâ€™s trajectory. 
In the third phase, I simulated how pilots  counteract the effects of wind by crabbing. In this project,
I have used multiple computational  methods such as integration, solving ODEs, and random processes to simulate aircraft movement and wind.
